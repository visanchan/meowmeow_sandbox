# Glossary — terms you'll see in MochiPOS

> Plain-language definitions, alphabetical. Each entry: 1-2 sentences + (when useful) the booth analogy and the file/table where it actually lives.
> Companion to [LEARNING.md](LEARNING.md). When you read a term you don't know, look it up here first.

---

## A

**Action (Server Action)** — A function that runs on the server but is called from a client component as if it were local. The framework handles the network call invisibly. *Anchor:* `src/app/apply/actions.ts` (the `submitApplication` function).

**Anon (anonymous) key** — The Supabase API key safe to ship to the browser. Limited by RLS so a leaked anon key cannot bypass tenant isolation. *Env var:* `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`.

**App Router** — The Next.js convention where the URL path matches the folder path under `src/app/`. Replaces the older "pages" directory. *Anchor:* the whole `src/app/` tree.

**Async / await** — A way to write asynchronous code (waiting for a database, an email, etc.) that reads top-to-bottom. `await x()` means "pause here until `x` finishes." *Anchor:* every server component you've seen, e.g. `src/app/page.tsx`.

**Atomic** — All-or-nothing. Either every part of the action happens, or none of it. *Anchor:* `create_order` is atomic — if stock can't decrement, the order isn't inserted either.

**Audit log** — Append-only history of important actions. Even admins shouldn't be able to delete it. *Anchor:* `audit_logs` table; every important RPC writes a row.

**Auth (authentication)** — Verifying *who* someone is. *Anchor:* Supabase Auth — when a user logs in, every request gets a JWT token; the database reads it as `auth.uid()`.

**Authz (authorization)** — Deciding *what* someone is allowed to do. Different from auth. *Anchor:* `workspace_members.role` (`owner`, `cashier`, etc.) plus RLS policies.

---

## B

**Backend** — Code that runs on a server, never on the user's device. Does anything the browser can't be trusted with. *Booth:* the manager in the back room.

**`bigint`** — A 64-bit integer type in Postgres. Used for money in MochiPOS (stored as satang) so no float-precision bugs. *Anchor:* `products.price_satang bigint`.

**Branch (Git)** — A copy of the code you can edit without affecting the main version. *Anchor:* `pos/wave-41-...` etc.; `main` is the trunk.

**Build** — The process of compiling source code into production-ready JavaScript / HTML. *Command:* `npm run build`.

---

## C

**Client component** — A React component that runs in the browser. Has `"use client"` on line 1. Can use `useState`, `onClick`, animations. *Anchor:* `src/app/apply/Form.tsx`.

**Commit (Git)** — One saved snapshot on a branch. *Command:* `git commit -m "..."`.

**Component** — A reusable piece of UI defined as a function that returns JSX. *Anchor:* `src/app/app/pos/ProductCard.tsx`.

**Cookie** — A small piece of data the browser stores and sends to the server with every request. Used for sessions/auth. *Anchor:* `src/lib/supabase/server.ts` reads/sets cookies for Supabase Auth.

**CRUD** — Create, Read, Update, Delete. The four basic operations on database rows.

---

## D

**Database** — Long-term memory. Survives server restarts. *Anchor:* Supabase Postgres — see `database/schema.sql`. *Booth:* locked file cabinet.

**Demo mode** — MochiPOS's fallback when no Supabase is configured. State lives in localStorage instead of a real database. *Anchor:* everything under `src/lib/demo/`.

**Deploy** — Push code from your laptop to a server so the public can use it. *Anchor:* Vercel does this automatically when you merge to `main`.

**DevTools** — The browser's built-in debugger. Press F12. Most useful tabs: Elements (HTML), Console (JS messages), Network (frontend↔backend traffic), Application (cookies + localStorage).

**Dynamic route** — A URL where part of the path is a placeholder. *Anchor:* `src/app/register/[token]/page.tsx` → URLs like `/register/abc123`. The `[token]` is a parameter.

---

## E

**Edge function** — A small backend function deployed to many regions for low latency. MochiPOS doesn't use these yet.

**Environment variable** — A piece of config (URL, secret) that's different per environment. Read via `process.env.NAME`. *Anchor:* `.env.local` on your laptop, Vercel project settings in production.

**ESLint** — The tool that flags bad/risky code patterns. Runs on `npm run lint`. *Anchor:* `eslint.config.mjs`.

**Event (in MochiPOS)** — One booth/fair, e.g. "Pet Expo Thailand 2026". *Anchor:* `events` table. Has `start_date`, `end_date`, `status`.

**Event inventory** — Per-product stock at one event. *Anchor:* `event_inventory` table. Has `current_qty`, `sample_qty`, `sold_qty`, etc.

---

## F

**Foreign key** — A column that points to another table's primary key, enforcing a relationship. *Anchor:* `products.workspace_id` references `workspaces.id`.

**Frontend** — The screen the user looks at and clicks. Runs in the browser. *Booth:* the cashier.

**Function (Postgres)** — Code that runs *inside the database*. Can do many things in one transaction. *Anchor:* `database/functions/create_order.sql`.

---

## G

**Git** — The version-control system. Tracks every change to the codebase. *Commands you'll use:* `git status`, `git checkout -b`, `git commit`, `git push`.

**GitHub** — The website where the Git repo lives so you and AI agents can push/pull. *Anchor:* `https://github.com/visanchan/meowmeow_sandbox`.

---

## H

**Honeypot** — A hidden form field that real users won't fill but bots will. If it's filled, the submission is silently rejected. *Anchor:* `website` field in `src/app/apply/Form.tsx` and the check in `actions.ts`.

**Hosting** — Where the app lives so anyone on the internet can reach it. *Anchor:* Vercel + Supabase.

**Hot reload** — When the dev server detects a code change and updates the browser without a manual refresh. *Anchor:* automatic with `npm run dev`.

---

## I

**i18n (internationalization)** — Making the app translate between languages. MochiPOS supports EN + TH. *Anchor:* `src/lib/i18n/dictionaries.ts`.

**Idempotent** — Running it twice has the same result as running it once. *Anchor:* migrations in `database/migrations/` use `if not exists` so they're idempotent.

**Invite code** — A one-shot code MochiPOS emails after admin approves an application. Used to redeem an account. *Anchor:* `invite_codes` table; redemption RPC `redeem_invite_code` in `database/functions/redeem_invite_code.sql`.

---

## J

**JSON** — A text format for data: `{"key": "value", "n": 123}`. The lingua franca of web APIs. *Anchor:* form values, RPC payloads, etc.

**JWT (JSON Web Token)** — A signed token proving a user is logged in. Sent with every Supabase request. The database reads it as `auth.uid()`.

---

## K

**Key (Supabase)** — Three Supabase keys: URL (project address), anon (public, RLS-restricted), service role (admin bypass — server only).

---

## L

**Layout** — A file that wraps every page underneath it in a folder. *Anchor:* `src/app/layout.tsx` (whole site), `src/app/app/layout.tsx` (every `/app/*` URL — adds nav + auth gate).

**localStorage** — Browser-side persistent storage. Survives page reloads but lives only on that device. *Anchor:* `src/lib/demo/*.ts` use it as a stand-in for a real database during demo mode.

**Lint** — Static analysis that flags risky patterns. *Command:* `npm run lint`.

---

## M

**Migration** — A SQL file that changes the database schema in a controlled, repeatable way. *Anchor:* `database/migrations/2026-05-07_*.sql`.
